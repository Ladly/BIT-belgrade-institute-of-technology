        <li>Using the console, create several variables using different letter cases and beginning characters. Check if they still exist if you refer to them in different case - does case matter here? Try to declare a variable starting with number as the first character.</li>
        <li>Save a string describing your current mood in a variable and print it out in console.</li>
        <li>Feel free to play around in the console and get familiar with it.</li>
        <li>Play around in the console: add, subtract, multiply and divide some numbers. Use numbers stored in variables you created as well. Think about expressions: 3-2-31, 3*5-7/3, 4/2-1.14*3. Why do we get these results? </li>
        <li>How many grams weight 1.2kg of bananas?</li>
        <li>How many extra seconds we wait for our friend Anna who is being late for 5 minutes? What about Tom who is being late half an hour? It hard to be on time these days…</li>
        <li>How many MB of additional memory we have if we buy a 4GB USB stick? How many news article each in size 98KB can fit in it?</li>
        <li>Create a variable yearOfBirth containing your year of birth. Check what’s the difference between yearOfBirth + 1 and yearOfBirth++. Can you use the similar principle with any other operator?</li>
        <li>Do you know any other way to write a = a * 2? How about: b = b + 3; c = c / 5; d = d - 7?</li>
        <li> Create the following variables:
                - a variable containing your name,
                - a variable containing your age,
                - a variable describing if you have a cat or not.
            * Each variable has to start with a different type of character.
            Print them all out in the console and check their types.
            </li>
        <li>Check which type are these values:
                - “number”
                - true
                - null
                - “false”
                - 56
            </li>
        <li>Check how good you are at guessing the Boolean equivalent of different values using the console. Do you remember how to check for a Boolean equivalent of a value?</li>
        <li>Use the console to check the results you think should go in the following table:</li>  
        <li>If the variable age stores the information about user’s age, how we can check whether it contains a correct value? Can age be a negative value? Do we expect it to be greater than 120? </li>

        <li> Let’s say there are speed limitations on a motorway from 60 to 120 kilometers per hour. If we store the current speed value in the variable speed how we can check if we drive safely?   </li>
